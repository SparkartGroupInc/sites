# Solidus Development Environment

This repo is designed to help you easily get Solidus sites running locally for development. We accomplish this largely by running everything within a Linux virtual machine. Itâ€™s easy to get up and running, time required is primarily to download everything. This repo contains a basic [Vagrantfile](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/vagrantfile/), configured to use the [vagrant-solidus](https://github.com/solidusjs/vagrant-solidus) plugin. The plugin handles everything necessary to run your Solidus sites, please refer to [its documentation](https://github.com/solidusjs/vagrant-solidus) to get started.
